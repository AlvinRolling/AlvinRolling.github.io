The repository [vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore) is an excellent resource for Vim learners, focusing on fundamental Vim capabilities. However, to further augment Vim's functionalities, plugins play a crucial role. Many aspects covered in `vim-galore` can be enhanced by leveraging powerful plugin tools.

## Enhanced Vim-Galore

### Completion

Several plugins support auto-completion, with my current preference being `YouCompleteMe`.

### Motions

For enhanced motion capabilities, consider using `vim-easymotion`.

### Changelist & Jumplist

Consider bundling with `vim-fzf` for improved changelist and jumplist navigation.

### Colorschemes

`iTerm2` provides its own color schemes.

### Sessions

For session management, I find that `tmux` could offer better functionality.

### Cscope

As an alternative to Cscope, `universal-ctags` proves to be a superior option.

### True Colors

The issue of true colors is internally resolved by `iTerm2`.
